# Pay-Per-View Application
An open source fork of FARM's 10 Billion Lives Android application. This application allows you to play a video to one or more people, have them fill out a survey, and collect their e-mail addresses for follow-up communication.

# Opening the Admin Menu
If you are using this application for your own needs, you will need to be able to open the admin menu. The admin menu is opened by 3 invisible buttons in the corners pressed in succession on any screen. Upper left, lower left, lower right. 

# Setting Up A Place To Receive Collected Data
Survey data is saved locally on the device and will need to be uploaded to a chosen back end location. You can customize this upload location in your own fork. There is also an option to email the data as a CSV if you do not want to set up your own upload location. 

# Customizing The Application 
This application comes with a small example video and subtitle file used as the source files. If you wish to customize the video or survey experience you can do so in the code in your own fork or you can add a new video and subtitle file dynaically in the admin menu. Just copy the link to a direct download and the new file will be set as the video or subtitle source.
